### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd blfs-cafe
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# Database
DATABASE_URL="postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/baristaos?schema=public"

# NextAuth
AUTH_SECRET="your-secret-key-here"
AUTH_URL="http://localhost:3000"

# Email Configuration (for notifications)
SMTP_HOST="smtp.gmail.com"
SMTP_PORT="587"
SMTP_USER="your-email@gmail.com"
SMTP_PASSWORD="your-app-password"
SMTP_FROM="your-email@gmail.com"

# Socket.io (optional, for production)
NEXT_PUBLIC_SOCKET_URL="http://localhost:3001"
```

**Note**: Generate a secure `AUTH_SECRET` using:
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

### 4. Database Setup

```bash
# Generate Prisma Client
npx prisma generate

# Run migrations
npx prisma migrate dev

# (Optional) Seed the database with sample data
npm run prisma:seed

## 🗄️ Database Schema

The application uses Prisma ORM with PostgreSQL. Key models include:

- **User**: User accounts with roles (admin/customer)
- **Product**: Menu items (coffee, tea, etc.)
- **Ingredient**: Customization options (milks, syrups, etc.)
- **Order**: Customer orders with status tracking
- **OrderItem**: Individual items within an order
- **SavedOrder**: User favorites
- **Schedule**: Cafe operating hours
- **Communication**: Announcements and banners
- **Suggestion**: User feedback and suggestions

See `prisma/schema.prisma` for the complete schema definition.

## 🚀 Development

### Available Scripts

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linter
npm run lint

# Database commands
npx prisma studio          # Open Prisma Studio (database GUI)
npx prisma migrate dev     # Create and apply migrations
npx prisma generate        # Regenerate Prisma Client
npm run prisma:seed        # Seed database
```

### Development Guidelines

- **Type Safety**: Strict TypeScript is enforced. Avoid using `any`.
- **Server Actions**: Use Server Actions (`'use server'`) for mutations instead of API routes.
- **Styling**: Use Tailwind CSS for all styling. Follow the established design patterns.
- **Components**: Keep components small and focused on a single responsibility.
- **Database**: Always read `schema.prisma` before making database queries. Never guess column names.

## 🎨 Design System

### Admin Interface
- **Background**: Dark Navy (`#004876` or `bg-gray-900`)
- **Accents**: Bright Blue (`#32A5DC`)
- **Text**: White (`text-white`) or Light Gray (`text-gray-400`)

### Customer Interface
- **Background**: Blue with dot pattern (`#004876`)
- **Accents**: Bright Blue (`#32A5DC`)
- **Cards**: White with subtle shadows

### Icons
- Custom outline-style icons (single color, consistent style)
- Located in `src/components/icons/`

## 📦 Deployment

For detailed deployment instructions, see [DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md](./DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md).

The application can be deployed to:
- AWS EC2 (with PM2 and Nginx)
- Vercel
- Any Node.js hosting platform

### Quick Deployment Checklist

1. Set up PostgreSQL database (RDS or managed service)
2. Configure environment variables
3. Run database migrations
4. Build the application: `npm run build`
5. Start the production server: `npm start`
6. Configure reverse proxy (Nginx) for production
7. Set up SSL certificate (Let's Encrypt)
8. Configure Socket.io server for real-time updates

## 🔐 Authentication

The application uses NextAuth v5 with:
- **Credentials Provider**: Email/password authentication
- **JWT Sessions**: Stateless session management
- **Role-Based Access**: Admin and customer roles
- **Guest Checkout**: Orders can be placed without authentication

## 📧 Email Notifications

Email notifications are sent for:
- Order status updates (per-drink or order-complete)
- Password reset requests
- Account-related communications

Configure SMTP settings in environment variables.

## 🤝 Contributing

1. Follow the existing code style and patterns
2. Ensure all TypeScript types are properly defined
3. Test on mobile devices for responsiveness
4. Update documentation as needed
5. Follow the project's design system and UI patterns

## 📝 Important Notes

- **No Payment Processing**: This is a free service. No payment references should appear in the UI.
- **Guest Orders**: Orders can have `null` user values. Always check for user existence before accessing user properties.
- **Order IDs**: Order IDs are integers, not strings. Convert to string when needed for display.
- **Real-Time Updates**: Socket.io is used for live order status updates. Ensure the socket server is running in production.
